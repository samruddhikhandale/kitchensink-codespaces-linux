Creating, managing and sharing checklists / todo lists has never been easier.

With ShaDo - the shareable checklists app one can easily create checklists, add or remove todo items, mark them as done on the go.

Most importantly if you are working on a plan with others, you can create a checklist and share with them. Everyone with a link to the list can add/edit todo items as well as mark items as done when they are done.

Be it a list of places you want to visit, set of tasks for your personal projects, or even a list of grocery items to buy which you want to edit along with your family members - ShaDo is your best companion.
